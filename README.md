# Project Overview
This project is designed for comprehensive data analysis, model training, and serving predictions via a FastAPI application. It includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and an API server for real-time predictions.

# File Descriptions
data_exploration.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook for initial data exploration, including data import, cleaning, and EDA.

model_training_pipeline.py: A Python script for setting up and running the data processing and machine learning pipeline, including model training and evaluation.

api_server.py: A FastAPI application script for deploying the trained model, providing endpoints for model status, version, and predictions.

additional_analysis.ipynb: An additional Jupyter notebook for further data analyses or experiments (name suggested based on general content).

data_preprocessing.py: A Python script for initial data cleaning and preprocessing steps (name suggested based on general content).

test_data.csv / sample_predictions.csv: A CSV file containing test data for the model or sample predictions output by the model.

# Installation
Install Python and necessary libraries.
Clone the repository.
Running the API Server
Execute uvicorn api_server:app --reload to start the FastAPI server.

# Usage
Perform EDA and additional analyses using the Jupyter notebooks.
Run the model_training_pipeline.py to train the model.
Use the FastAPI server for making predictions.
